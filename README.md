Java Implementation of Multiple Sorting Techniques

BUBBLE SORT
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position in each pass
The time complexity for code is O(n^2).
How It Works:
Compare the first two elements of the array.

If the first is greater than the second, swap them.

Move to the next pair and repeat step 2.

Continue this process until the end of the array.

After one full pass, the largest element is at the end.

Repeat the process for the remaining elements, excluding the last sorted elements.

Stop when no swaps are needed in a complete pass (array is sorted)
